       The Wailing Wall(as it is known in the West)</span> or Western Wall (derived from Hebrew: הַכּוֹתֶל הַמַּעֲרָבִי‎, romanized: HaKotel HaMa'aravi, lit. 'the western wall',[1] often shortened to the Kotel or Kosel),<br> known in Islam as the Buraq Wall (Arabic: Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق,[2] is an ancient limestone wall in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall,<br> known also in its entirety as the "Western Wall".<br>[3] The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the Second Jewish Temple begun by Herod the Great,<br>[4] which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount, in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings,and crowds of worshipers and visitors.

 <span style="color:green"<br>The newer Siloam Tunnel (Hebrew: נִקְבַּת הַשִּׁלֹחַ‎, Nikbat HaShiloah), also known as Hezekiah's Tunnel (Hebrew: תעלת חזקיהו‎, is a water channel that was carved within the City of David in ancient times,<br> now located in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan in eastern Jerusalem.<br> Its popular name is due to the most common hypothesis that it dates from the reign of Hezekiah<br> of Judah (late 8th and early 7th century BC) and corresponds to the "conduit" mentioned in 2 Kings 20:20 in the Hebrew Bible.<br>[1] According to the Bible, King Hezekiah prepared Jerusalem for an impending siege by the Assyrians, by "blocking the source of the waters of the upper Gihon,<br> and leading them straight down on the west to the City of David" (2 Chronicles 32:30). By diverting the waters of the Gihon,<br> he prevented the enemy forces under Sennacherib from having access to wate.
